### **About Me**
Hi, Iâ€™m **Venkat Krishnan**, a supply chain transformation leader with 20+ years of experience.  
I am passionate about blending **business strategy with AI/ML and optimization** to solve  
challenges in supply chain,transportation, warehousing, and global trade.

This portfolio highlights:
- **Business problem framing** â€” turning logistics pain points into optimization problems.
- **Rapid prototyping** with open-source AI/ML and optimization libraries.
- **Storytelling with data** â€” explaining how these solutions create measurable business impact.

### **Why I Built This**
I created **SupplyChain.ai** to showcase:
- How quickly we can build **AI-powered pilots** for supply chain problems.
- The **business value of optimization** (cost savings, SLA compliance, network efficiency).
- The potential of **open-source tools** like Python, OR-Tools, and Streamlit for enterprise solutions.
