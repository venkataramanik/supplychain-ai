Welcome to **SupplyChain.ai** ‚Äî a portfolio of interactive prototypes designed to showcase how  
**AI, Machine Learning, and Optimization** can solve real-world supply chain and logistics challenges.

### **About Me**
Hi, I‚Äôm **Venkat Krishnan**, a supply chain transformation leader with 20+ years of experience.  
I‚Äôm deeply passionate about applying **AI/ML and mathematical optimization** to solve complex  
business problems ‚Äî from **transportation planning** to **network design**.

This app is a personal project in:
- **Business problem framing** ‚Äî connecting logistics pain points with optimization opportunities.
- **Modern AI & open-source tools** ‚Äî using Python, OR-Tools, and Streamlit to build rapid prototypes.
- **Storytelling through data** ‚Äî explaining not just the ‚Äúhow‚Äù but also the **business impact**.

### **Why I Built This**
I wanted to show how **quickly AI and optimization pilots can be spun up** when you combine  
deep domain knowledge with open-source technologies. Each pilot highlights:
- **The business problem** (e.g., cost reduction, SLA compliance).
- **KPIs and metrics** to measure impact.
- **A simple but working optimization demo** (backed by real algorithms).
- **Fun facts and industry references** (e.g., how UPS saves millions via VRP).

### **Explore the Pilots**
- **Transportation Optimization Suite** ‚Äî From shipment mode selection to advanced vehicle routing.
- More supply chain pilots (e.g., **tariff impact, network design**) coming soon.
