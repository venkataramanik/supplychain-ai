# --- BUSINESS CONTEXT ---
st.header("Business Problem")
st.markdown("""
Many shipments have **fixed delivery time windows** (e.g., 10:00–12:00). Routing vehicles 
while meeting these constraints is far more complex and missing time windows 
can result in **SLA (Service Level Agreement) penalties** or dissatisfied customers.

**KPIs Impacted:**
- **On-time delivery %.**
- **SLA penalty costs.**
- **Customer satisfaction (CSAT).**

# --- WHY THIS APPROACH ---
st.header("Why This Approach?")
st.markdown("""
VRP with Time Windows (**VRPTW**) extends the classic VRP by adding **temporal constraints**. 
Solving VRPTW allows companies to:
- Ensure **timely deliveries** while minimizing costs.
- Balance **driver schedules** with customer SLAs.
- Handle high-complexity routes efficiently.
""")

# --- TOOLS USED ---
st.header("Tools Used")
st.markdown("""
- **Google OR-Tools:** Supports VRPTW and constraint programming.
- **pandas:** For handling time windows and order data.
- **Plotly/Folium:** For time-aware route visualization.
""")

# --- MATH BEHIND IT ---
st.header("Math Behind It")
st.markdown(r"""
VRPTW adds time constraints:

\[
ReadyTime_i \leq ArrivalTime_i \leq DueTime_i
\]

Where:
- **\(ArrivalTime_i\)** = actual time vehicle arrives at customer i.
- **\(ReadyTime_i\)** and **\(DueTime_i\)** = allowable delivery window.

# --- AI & ML ANGLE ---
st.header("How AI & ML Enhance VRPTW")
st.markdown("""
- **ML Models:** Predict delays based on historical traffic and weather patterns.
- **LLMs:** Automatically interpret SLA rules and translate them into constraints.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Dynamic adjustment of delivery schedules in real time.

# --- FUN FACT ---
st.header("Fun Fact")
st.markdown("""
> VRPTW is **NP-hard**, meaning it cannot be solved efficiently at large scale, 
which is why heuristic/metaheuristic approaches (Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms) 
are often used in production systems.
