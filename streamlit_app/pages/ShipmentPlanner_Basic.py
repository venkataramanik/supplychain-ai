# --- Business Explanation ---
st.markdown("## üìù How This Works")
st.markdown("""
1. **Shipment Data:** We simulate 50 shipments with realistic distances and weights.  
2. **Cost Model:** For each shipment, both **Parcel** and **LTL** costs are computed using:  
   - `Total Cost = Base + (Cost per Mile √ó Distance) + (Cost per Pound √ó Weight)`.  
3. **Mode Selection:** The cheapest mode is chosen per shipment, simulating a **rate-shopping engine**.  
4. **Analytics:** We aggregate total cost by mode and visualize it using a bar chart.  
5. **Custom Scenario:** Users can test "what-if" costs for a single shipment.

### **Why It Matters**
- **Parcel vs. LTL Trade-off:** LTL is cheaper for heavier shipments over longer distances due to economies of scale.  
- **Real-World Relevance:** Logistics companies like UPS and FedEx use similar logic, enhanced with **zone-based pricing, dimensional weight, and service-level guarantees**.  
- **Scalability:** The logic can easily scale to 10,000+ shipments with vectorized calculations or Spark/PySpark pipelines.
