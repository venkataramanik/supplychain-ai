st.markdown("""
Transportation networks face **multi-dimensional challenges** â€” rising costs, strict SLAs, sustainability goals, 
and increasing delivery complexity. Industry leaders solve these using a **blend of AI, ML, and optimization** to 
orchestrate millions of shipments in real time.

This suite showcases **business-first AI solutions** with a mix of:
- **Dynamic cost rating & mode selection** (Parcel vs LTL vs FTL).
- **Vehicle routing optimization (VRP & its variants).**
- **Cross-dock and multi-echelon planning.**
- **Multi-modal & sustainability trade-offs.**
- **Dynamic, event-driven re-routing.**

- **Predictive ETA & Demand Models:** Machine learning (XGBoost, ARIMA, or deep learning) predicts delays and costs.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Adaptive routing engines learn from real-time conditions (like ride-sharing systems).
- **Generative AI (LLMs):** Automates carrier rate table parsing and rapidly prototypes optimization models.
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Cutting-edge approach for solving large-scale VRPs.
