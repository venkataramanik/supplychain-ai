# **SupplyChain.ai**  
*Exploring how AI & Optimization can reshape supply chains.*

---

## **About Me**  
I’m passionate about solving complex **supply chain and logistics problems** by combining **mathematics, optimization, and AI/ML**.  
My curiosity drives me to explore **how open-source tools and large language models (LLMs)** can accelerate the creation of intelligent, real-world solutions.

When I’m not building supply chain prototypes, you’ll find me:  
- **Experimenting with AI/ML** and cutting-edge optimization techniques.  
- **Reading about logistics, transportation, and agentic AI.**  
- **Exploring new open-source frameworks** to see how they can solve business problems faster.

## **What Is This Repository?**  
This is a **portfolio of AI-powered supply chain prototypes** that demonstrate how **open-source technology and optimization algorithms** can tackle real business challenges.

---

## **Current Pilots**  
### **1. Shipment Planner**  
- Mode selection (Parcel/LTL)  
- Rating and cost optimization  
- Route optimization with interactive maps  

### **2. Tariff Impact Simulator**  
- Scenario-based landed cost analysis when tariffs change.  

### **3. Network Design Tool**  
- Facility location optimization for cost and service trade-offs.

## **Vision**  
This portfolio showcases how **AI + Optimization + Open Source** can:  
- **Solve real-world supply chain challenges** in hours instead of weeks.  
- **Empower businesses to test scenarios, optimize routes, and reduce costs** with transparent, reproducible prototypes.

---

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend:** Streamlit for rapid interactive UIs.  
- **Optimization:** OR-Tools, PuLP, heuristic/metaheuristic models.  
- **ML/AI:** scikit-learn, XGBoost (for forecasting, ETA prediction).  
- **Visualization:** Plotly, Folium for maps and dashboards.

---

## **Live Demos**  
**Coming soon** — interactive apps will be available via Streamlit Cloud.
